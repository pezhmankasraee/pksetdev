## Git Branching & Release Strategy

1. **main**: Production-ready code. Only updated via pull requests from release or hotfix branches.
2. **develop**: Integration branch for features. All feature branches are merged here.
3. **release-vM.m.p**: Created from `develop` when preparing a new release.
   - Final fixes, version bumps, and documentation updates are made here.
   - Pull request from `release-vM.m.p` to `main` for final review.
   - When the PR is created the release action will be triggered, then the action will create a tag based on postfix in release branch name, and then create a draft release.
   - After review the draft review, first the release branch should be merged to `main`, and then the draft release should be published.
   - Merge back to `develop` if there were changes.
4. **hotfix/x.y.z**: For urgent fixes to production. Branched from `main`, then merged into both `main` and `develop`.

**Release Steps:**
1. Branch from `develop` to `release-vM.m.p`
2. Finalize release (fixes, docs, version bump)
3. Push the branch `release-vM.m.p`
4. The push will trigger the `create-tag` workflow/actin, and it will create the tag with version `vM.m.p` which points to the head of of `release-vM.m.p` branch
5. Create PR from `release-vM.m.p` to `main`, creating PR will trigger `draft-release` workflow/action and it creates draft release
6. Merge release to `main` (and back to `develop` if needed)
7. Review and publish draft release

### Back merge
you do not always need to back-merge from main (or master) to develop after every release, but you should do so whenever there have been changes or fixes made directly to main that are not yet in develop. This is a core part of the Git Flow model and is considered best practice in many team workflows

When should you back-merge from main to develop?

*   After a release:
    If you made any final changes, fixes, or version bumps on the release branch before merging into main, those changes should also be merged back into develop to keep both branches in sync

*   After a hotfix:
    Hotfixes are usually branched from main to fix urgent production issues. Once merged into main, the hotfix should also be merged into develop to ensure ongoing development includes the fix
