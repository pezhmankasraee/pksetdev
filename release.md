Great! Let's break down your first requirement for the `release.yml` GitHub Action step by step, using simple language but the right technical terms.

---

## What You Want to Do

- You have a branch named like `release-v1.2.3` (always starts with `release-` and then a version number).
- When you create a **pull request** from this branch to `main` or `master`, you want:
  - A **GitHub Action** to run automatically.
  - This action should create a **tag** named `v1.2.3` (the version part) from the branch name.

---

## Step 1: Triggering the Workflow

**What is a Trigger?**
A *trigger* tells GitHub when to run your workflow. In your case, you want it to run when a pull request is made from a branch like `release-v1.2.3` to `main` or `master`.

**How to Set the Trigger**
- Use the `pull_request` event in your workflow file.
- You can specify which branches to trigger on (for example, only when the base branch is `main` or `master`).
- You can also filter to only run when the pull request comes from a branch with the `release-` prefix.

**Example YAML:**
```yaml
name: Release Tag

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, reopened, synchronize]
    branches:
      - main
      - master
```
- `on`: This section defines the event that starts the workflow.
- `pull_request`: This means the workflow runs when a pull request is created, reopened, or updated.
- `branches`: This limits the workflow to only run when the pull request targets `main` or `master`[1][3][7].

---

## Step 2: Filtering the Source Branch

You only want this workflow to run if the source branch (the branch you're merging from) starts with `release-`.

**How to Do This:**
- Use a conditional (`if`) statement in your job to check the branch name.

**Example:**
```yaml
jobs:
  create_tag:
    if: startsWith(github.head_ref, 'release-')
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # Steps will go here
```
- `if: startsWith(github.head_ref, 'release-')`: This checks if the branch name starts with `release-` before running the job.

---

## Step 3: Extracting the Version Number

You want to create a tag like `v1.2.3` from the branch name `release-v1.2.3`.

**How to Do This:**
- Use a shell command to get the version part from the branch name.

**Example Step:**
```yaml
- name: Extract version
  id: extract_version
  run: echo "VERSION=$(echo ${GITHUB_HEAD_REF#release-})" >> $GITHUB_ENV
```
- This takes the branch name, removes `release-`, and saves the result as `VERSION` for later steps.

---

## Step 4: Creating the Tag

Now, use the version you extracted to create a tag.

**Example Step:**
```yaml
- name: Create tag
  run: |
    git config --global user.name "github-actions"
    git config --global user.email "github-actions@github.com"
    git fetch --all
    git tag $VERSION
    git push origin $VERSION
  env:
    VERSION: ${{ env.VERSION }}
```
- This configures Git, creates the tag, and pushes it to your repository.

---

## Putting It All Together

Here’s a simplified version of what your `release.yml` might look like:

```yaml
name: Release Tag

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, reopened, synchronize]
    branches:
      - main
      - master

jobs:
  create_tag:
    if: startsWith(github.head_ref, 'release-')
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Extract version
        id: extract_version
        run: echo "VERSION=$(echo ${GITHUB_HEAD_REF#release-})" >> $GITHUB_ENV

      - name: Create tag
        run: |
          git config --global user.name "github-actions"
          git config --global user.email "github-actions@github.com"
          git fetch --all
          git tag $VERSION
          git push origin $VERSION
        env:
          VERSION: ${{ env.VERSION }}
```

## Key Terms Explained

- **Workflow**: The full automation file (`release.yml`) that controls what happens and when[6].
- **Job**: A group of steps that run on the same machine.
- **Step**: A single task, like running a command or script.
- **Trigger/Event**: What starts the workflow (here, a pull request).
- **Tag**: A label in Git that marks a specific commit, often used for releases.

Great catch! You are absolutely right.

By default, GitHub Actions workflows have **read-only** permissions for the `GITHUB_TOKEN`.  
To create or push a tag, you need **write** permissions to the repository contents.

Let’s explain and add this step-by-step:

---

## Why Do You Need Write Permissions?

- **Read permissions** allow the workflow to view the code and repository data.
- **Write permissions** are required to make changes, like pushing a tag to the repository.
- If you try to push a tag with only read permissions, you’ll get a permission error.

---

## How to Set Write Permissions

You can set permissions at the top of your workflow file using the `permissions` key.

**Example:**
```yaml
permissions:
  contents: write
```
- This line gives the workflow permission to write (push) to the repository contents, including tags and releases.

---

## Where to Add This in Your Workflow

Add the `permissions` section at the top of your `release.yml`, right after the `name:` and before the `on:` section.

**Here’s how your file should start:**
```yaml
name: Release Tag

permissions:
  contents: write

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, reopened, synchronize]
    branches:
      - main
      - master

# ...rest of the workflow...
```

---

## Summary

- **permissions: contents: write** is required to push tags.
- Place it at the top of your workflow file.
- Without it, the workflow cannot push tags and will fail with a permission error.
